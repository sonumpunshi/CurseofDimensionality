# Curse of Dimensionality in Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the concept of the **Curse of Dimensionality** in machine learning through various examples. The notebook covers the impact of high-dimensional data on distance metrics and classification accuracy, as well as methods for mitigating these issues using dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Introduction

The **Curse of Dimensionality** refers to the various phenomena that arise when analyzing data in high-dimensional spaces. As the number of features (dimensions) in a dataset increases, several challenges can emerge, including the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics, increased likelihood of overfitting, and higher computational costs.

## Impact on Distance Metrics

This section illustrates how distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance, become less meaningful as the number of dimensions increases. The notebook generates random data points in high-dimensional spaces and calculates the average distance between them, showing that points become more uniformly distant from each other as dimensions increase.

## Impact on Classification Accuracy

The notebook demonstrates how increasing the number of dimensions can lead to reduced accuracy in machine learning models, such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). This effect is shown by keeping the number of informative features constant while adding more irrelevant dimensions, which adds noise and reduces model performance.

## Dimensionality Reduction Techniques

### Feature Selection using RFE

The notebook uses Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to automatically select the most important features in a dataset, reducing the dimensionality while retaining the most relevant information.

### Feature Extraction using PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to transform the original features into a smaller set of new features (principal components) that capture most of the variance in the data. This technique helps in reducing dimensionality and mitigating the curse of dimensionality.


## Getting Started

To run the notebook, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
